    abstract = {{The collaborative filtering (CF) approach to recommenders has
recently enjoyed much interest and progress. The fact that it played a central
role within the recently completed Netflix competition has contributed to its
popularity. This chapter surveys the recent progress in the field. Matrix
factorization techniques, which became a first choice for implementing CF, are
described together with recent innovations. We also describe several extensions
that bring competitive accuracy into neighborhood methods, which used to
dominate the field. The chapter demonstrates how to utilize temporal models and
implicit feedback to extend models accuracy. In passing, we include detailed
descriptions of some the central methods developed for tackling the challenge of
the Netflix Prize competition.}},
