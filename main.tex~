\abstract{In todays digital world Information in the form of large scale data
has become a very important source of knowledge, this is largely owed to the
advances in Data Sciences. One of the recent applications of data mining is to
find meaningful and useful relationship between groups of entities, for
example between users and movies as in the case of NETFLIX. With the NETLIX
competition, the field of Recommender Systems which helps in presenting users
with relevant items based on the history rather than an explicit search query,
has generated great interest from researchers and this work is one such attempt.
When we talk about users' preferences it is natural that it evolves, hence in
this work we have tried to account for a new dimension, i.e time, while building
the model. On the lines on the NETFLIX competition, the task of predicting
preferences involves the ratings of the movies given by users and it is the
value of this rating which we try to predict. On the lines on the NETFLIX
competition, the task of predicting preferences involves the ratings of the
movies by users and it the value of this rating which we try to predict. The
data upon which the algorithm is built consists of around 1 million ratings
given by around half a million users to around 18k movies. Collaborative
Filtering techniques have been employed, where based upon a model which has
information of users and movies we try to fetch prediction of new ratings by
factoring the user space and movie space and finding a relationship between the
required pair. Matrix factorization is done based on Singular Value
Decomposition, and owing to the inherent nature of SVD to handle
sparse data inefficiently an alternate method based on Alternate Least Squares
was used.}
